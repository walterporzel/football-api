He is notable for being the first walk-on true freshman quarterback to start a season opener at a BCS school. Mayfield transferred from Texas Tech to Oklahoma following alleged scholarship issues and a lack of communication with coaches. After sitting out the 2014 season due to NCAA transfer rules, Mayfield won the starting quarterback job in 2015. He won several awards for his performance as a senior in 2017, including the Heisman Trophy, Maxwell Award, Walter Camp Award, and unanimous All-America recognition.Mayfield was drafted by the Browns first overall in the 2018 NFL Draft. In his first NFL appearance, Mayfield led Cleveland to their first win in 19 games, ending a 635 day winless streak. He threw 27 touchdowns in his 13 starts for the Browns in 2018, breaking the rookie-season, passing-TD record previously held by Peyton Manning and Russell Wilson.",

After a trade that sent Smith to the Washington Redskins, Mahomes was named the starter for the 2018 season. That season, he became only the third player in NFL history to throw 50 touchdown passes in a single season (Tom Brady and Peyton Manning both accomplished this feat in 2007 and 2013, respectively). He was named to the First Team All-Pro and was voted to the Pro Bowl for the first time in his career.",

        "strDescriptionEN": "Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr. (born August 3, 1977) is an American football quarterback for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). Due to his numerous accomplishments, records, and accolades, many analysts and sportswriters consider Brady to be among the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history.After playing college football for the University of Michigan, Brady was drafted by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. Due to his late selection, Brady is considered the biggest 'steal' in the history of the NFL Draft. In Brady's seventeen seasons as a starter, he has quarterbacked the Patriots to play in nine Super Bowls, and is one of only two quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl in their first season as a starter. He is the only player in NFL history to have won six Super Bowls.Brady has been honored with four Super Bowl MVP awards (Super Bowl XXXVI, XXXVIII, XLIX, and LI), the most ever by a player, and has won three league MVP awards (2007, 2010, 2017). Brady has also been selected to 14 Pro Bowls, and has led his team to more division titles (16) than any other quarterback in NFL history. He is fourth all-time in career passing yards for regular season play, third in career touchdown passes, and fourth in career passer rating. For regular season and postseason combined, Brady is first all-time in career passing yards and touchdown passes. Brady has also had amazing longevity for the quarterback position, setting numerous records for his age. Brady is the oldest quarterback to lead his team to a Super Bowl title with his win in Super Bowl LIII at the age of 41. He is also the oldest player to have won the Super Bowl MVP at age 39, and the oldest to have won the regular season MVP at 40.The only quarterback to reach 200 wins in the regular season, Brady is the winningest quarterback in NFL history. With a postseason record of 30–10, he is first all-time in playoff wins and appearances for an NFL player. Brady has led the Patriots to an NFL-record eight consecutive AFC championship games since 2011 (thirteen overall), and has never had a losing season in his 18 seasons as a starting quarterback in the NFL.For his alleged involvement in the highly publicized Deflategate football tampering scandal, Brady was suspended for the first four games of the 2016 season. Brady and the Patriots subsequently went on to win two of the next three Super Bowls, giving him the record for most Super Bowl wins by a player.",

He played college football at Miami University (Ohio), and was drafted by the Steelers in the first round (11th overall) of the 2004 NFL Draft.Roethlisberger earned the AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Award in 2004 and his first Pro Bowl selection in 2007. He became the youngest Super Bowl-winning quarterback in NFL history, leading the Steelers, in only his second professional season, to a 21–10 victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL at the age of 23. Roethlisberger led the Steelers to a second Super Bowl title in four seasons as they defeated the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII, 27–23, after completing a game-winning touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes with 35 seconds left in the game. He appeared in his third Super Bowl in Super Bowl XLV, but the team would fall by a score of 31-25 to the Green Bay Packers.Roethlisberger has been one of the most efficient passers in NFL history. He currently ranks 9th all-time in NFL passer rating (94.0), tied for 6th in yards per attempt (7.93), and tied for 10th in completion percentage (63.85%) among quarterbacks with a minimum of 1,500 career attempts. He has the fourth highest career winning percentage (.710) as a starter in the regular season among quarterbacks with a minimum of 100 starts. He is one of six quarterbacks in NFL history to have beaten at least 31 of the current NFL teams.Known for playing outside the pocket in what he calls 'backyard football', Roethlisberger grew up idolizing John Elway, and has often been compared to him. Roethlisberger wears number 7 in Elway's honor.",
